I used Python version 3.13.1.

There are three python files: main.py, model.py, classifier.py.

main.py has all the logic for running the app.

model.py is where the sketch classifier model was trained. 

classifier.py has the logic for taking the sketch grabbed from the app canvas and classifying it using the model generated from model.py

* Make sure connected to Internet before running

There is a requirements.txt file

Instructions:
- Run main.py file. Terminal will give a list of devices and their inputs. Change device_index variable to whatever device you are using for microphone

- Have to click enter after free-drawing on canvas if want to convert to standard symbol

Wait until terminal prints "Listening" after clicking "Start Record" button for best results
